Although groceries and household items will be ordered by Colin Keenan (with phone\# 816-200-2658) and delivered by Amazon Fresh, you may occasionly be asked to pickup something while shopping for yourself. This should add no more than fifteen minutes to your personal shopping trip, and you should call Colin to check in and out while shopping for Joan. Travel to and from the store will not be paid for because you will already be at the store when you begin shopping for Joan.
