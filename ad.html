<p>Please, everyone who thinks this is an easy and desirable job, you should apply regardless of your past work experience, background, sex, race, religion, or anything else. Don&#39;t count yourself out before you even apply. I&#39;m looking for <em>two positions</em> at <strong>$13.26/hr</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Weekday</strong> <strong>caregiver</strong> gets to work about 12-20 hours a week.</li>
	<li><strong>Weekend</strong> <strong>caregiver</strong> gets to work about 4 hours a week.</li>
</ol>

<p>Days may be swapped between the two employees. These jobs are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Easy and reliable extra income</li>
	<li>Paid every Monday for the week that just ended the day before</li>
	<li>Short shifts that are easy to do before or after your current job</li>
	<li>(You must live in Pasadena, California since each shift is only about an hour)</li>
</ul>

<p>No special skills, experience, or vehicle is required. You are probably qualified if you</p>

<ul>
	<li>prepare most of your own meals,</li>
	<li>keep your home reasonably clean and organized,</li>
	<li>are on time to appointments,</li>
	<li>and like to stay busy while working.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will</p>

<ul>
	<li>count out pills,</li>
	<li>measure insulin into a syringe (Joan will inject it herself),</li>
	<li>do a little basic house cleaning,</li>
	<li>prepare simple nutritious meals (sometimes just store-prepared items or frozen meals),</li>
	<li>check Joan&#39;s blood sugar (sometimes you can just ask her to check it),</li>
	<li>serve the meal and medicine,</li>
	<li>occasional assist with showers/grooming, and</li>
	<li>other duties every once in a while.</li>
</ul>

<p>The weekday employee would also be responsible for making medical and dental appointments, and then accompanying Joan on those appointments (no more than twice a week, and none in most weeks). Public transportation may be used and paid for by Joan, so no car is required, but you will be reimbursed for mileage at 57.5 cents per mile if you use your own car for these appointments.</p>

<p>You will get</p>

<ul>
	<li>a week or more of paid training, and</li>
	<li>chores listed on the refrigerator and bathroom wall, so you won&#39;t miss anything.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this sounds like an easy job to you, you probably qualify. I&#39;m looking for someone who is organized, intelligent, and good at following instructions.</p>
