			\item \textbf{Terminations}. 
				This Agreement shall be terminated upon the death of \lodger{}, upon a voluntary termination of this Agreement by \lodger{}, or by \management{}. \management{} may terminate this Agreement for various reasons, including, but not limited to, the nonpayment of rent, a serious or repeated violation of a material term of this Agreement, smoking, any Criminal Activity or Drug-Related Criminal Activity as set forth in items \ref{criminal} or \ref{drug} of of section \ref{generals} of this Agreement, or for any other reasons in the discretion of \management{}.

			\item \textbf{Involuntary Termination Notices}. \label{terminate}
				In terminating this Agreement, \management{} shall give a written notice of termination (``Notice of Termination'') of:

				\end{enumerate} 
				The Notice of Termination shall both state that \lodger{} is not welcome in \apt{} anymore, and provide a reminder that only Owner and \lodger{} reside in this \apt{}.

			\item \textbf{Service Of Termination Notice}. \label{service}
				When a notice of termination requires service pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure 1162, such service may be made by either:

				\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Notices}. 
		\begin{enumerate} 
			\item \textbf{Notice To \lodger{}}. 
				Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all notices required or permitted to be given to the \lodger{} shall be in writing and delivered to the \lodger{} by email to the \lemail{} or sent by prepaid first-class mail properly addressed to the \lodger{} at the \room{} in the \apt{}. If the \lodger{} is visually impaired, all notices shall be in an accessible format. 
			\item \textbf{Notice To Management}. 
				Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all notices to \management{} shall be delivered via \myemail{}.

	\item \textbf{Modifications And Amendments To This Agreement}. \label{modifications}

			\item by the written consent of both \management{} and the \lodger{}, or 
			\item \management{} (without the written consent of the \lodger{}) at any time during the term of the Agreement upon 7 day written notice. 
		\end{enumerate}
				
		This item \ref{modifications} of this section of the Agreement, shall not apply to changes authorized by this Agreement or law.
	\item \textbf{Waivers}. 
		\management{}'s failure to require strict compliance with any covenant, term or condition of this Agreement, or to exercise any right \management{} may have by reason of this Agreement, shall not be deemed a waiver by \management{} of such covenant, condition, term or right. \management{}'s acceptance of rent with the knowledge of any default by the \lodger{} to this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such default, nor shall it limit or impair \management{}'s right to enforce any subsequent default of the same covenant, condition, term or right. 
	\item \textbf{Captions}. 
		Section headings of this Agreement are solely for convenience of the parties and shall not be used to explain, modify, simplify, or aid in the interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 
	\item \textbf{Rights And Remedies Cumulative}. 
		All rights and remedies that \management{} may have under this Agreement or at law are cumulative and nonexclusive. 
	\item \textbf{Severability}. 
		If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will not be affected. In lieu of any provision which a court of competent jurisdiction finds to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, there will be added as a part of this Agreement a provision as similar to such provision as may be possible, yet be legal, valid and enforceable. 
	\item \textbf{The Effect Of Prior Rental Agreements}. 
		Providing the \lodger{} is not in default of any term, condition or covenant under any other rental agreement that is in force between the \lodger{} and \management{} at the time this Agreement becomes effective, all prior rental agreements will terminate. In all cases where the \lodger{} is in default under a rental agreement with \management{} at the time this Agreement becomes effective, any default under that agreement shall be deemed a default of this Agreement. 
	\item \textbf{Automatic Renewal}.
		Unless terminated, this Agreement shall be automatically renewed weekly on the same terms and conditions. 
	\item \textbf{Megan's Law Disclosure}.
		``Notice: Pursuant to Section 290.46 of the Penal Code, information about specified registered sex offenders is made available to the public via an Internet Web site maintained by the Department of Justice at www.meganslaw.ca.gov. Depending on an offender's criminal history, this information will include either the address at which the offender resides or the community of residence and ZIP Code in which he or she resides.''

\section{\specifics{}} \label{specifics} 
\subsection{Important Points \lodger{} Must Be Aware Of}
	Important points from section \ref{generals}, \generals{}, are repeated or restated as follows so as to not be missed by \lodger{}.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Applicability of Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code}\\*
			The \lodger{} understands and agrees with the following:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item this Agreement is week-to-week
				\item \lodger{} is contracting with Owner, the owner of \apt{}, for \room{}, a room within \apt{}
				\item \apt{} is personally occupied by Owner
				\item Owner retains a right of access to all areas of \apt{} occupied by \lodger{} 
				\item Owner has overall control of \apt{} 
				\item no one other than \lodger{} and Owner reside in \apt{}. 
			\end{enumerate}
			Therefore, \management{} may exercise it's rights under Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code, and do both of the following: 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Legally terminate this Agreement with only 3 to 7 day written notice of termination delivered to \lodger{} as outlined in items \ref{terminate} and \ref{service} of section \ref{generals} of this Agreement.
				\item Upon expiration of the 3-7 day notice period provided, remove \lodger{}'s possessions, and remove \lodger{} from \apt{} as a trespasser, without court order, pursuant to the provisions of Section 602.3 of the California Penal Code or other applicable provisions of law, because any right of \lodger{} to remain in the dwelling unit or any part thereof is terminated by operation of law pursuant to the provisions of Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code.
			\end{enumerate} 
			\lodger{} agrees to obey the provisions of Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code by vacating the premises before expiration of any legally delivered notice of termination of this Agreement.  
	
		\item \textbf{Impermanence, \rules{}, and \standards{}}\\*
			\lodger{} further understands and agrees with the following: 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item This Agreement is temporary and although automatically renewing weekly, this Agreement will eventually be terminated by \management{} when \management{} will no longer rent \room{} to anyone, even if \lodger{} has always been in good standing under this Agreement. 
				\item \management{} desires that \lodger{} clearly understands how to avoid premature termination of this Agreement, and so has provided rules as listed in Schedule A of this Agreement (``\rules{}''), and housekeeping standards as listed in Schedule B of this Agreement (``\standards{}''). 
				\item \management{} may change or add to \rules{} and \standards{} at will, providing those subsequent drafts to \lodger{} so that \lodger{} may obey them. 
				\item \lodger{} shall obey the \rules{} and \standards{} as currently and subsequently drafted and delivered to \lodger{} in order to avoid premature termination of this Agreement.
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{Honesty}\\*
			The \lodger{} understands and agrees that \management{} is entering into this Agreement in reliance upon the truth, completeness and accuracy of information provided in the \lodger{}'s initial application for a lodging rental. Furthermore, the \lodger{} understands and agrees that \management{} is relying on the truth, completeness and accuracy of all future information to be provided by the \lodger{}. Should it be discovered that any such information is false, misleading, or incomplete, \management{} may terminate this Agreement which may result in additional rent being owed by the \lodger{} and/or lead to other legal action and remedies which may be appropriate under the law.
