	\item \textbf{The Effect Of Prior Rental Agreements}. 
		Providing the \lodger{} is not in default of any term, condition or covenant under any other rental agreement that is in force between the \lodger{} and \management{} at the time this Agreement becomes effective, all prior rental agreements will terminate.

\section{\specifics{}} \label{specifics} 
\subsection{Important Points \lodger{} Must Be Aware Of}
	Important points from section \ref{generals}, \generals{}, are repeated or restated as follows so as to not be missed by \lodger{}.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Applicability of Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code}\\*
			The \lodger{} understands and agrees with the following:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item this Agreement is week-to-week
				\item \lodger{} is contracting with Owner, the owner of \apt{}, for \room{}, a room within \apt{}
				\item \apt{} is personally occupied by Owner
				\item Owner retains a right of access to all areas of \apt{} occupied by \lodger{} 
				\item Owner has overall control of \apt{} 
				\item no one other than \lodger{} and Owner reside in \apt{}. 
			\end{enumerate}
			Therefore, \management{} may exercise it's rights under Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Upon receipt of 3-7 day notice of termination delivered to \lodger{} as outlined in items \ref{terminate} and \ref{service} of section \ref{generals} of this Agreement, \lodger{} agrees to obey the provisions of Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code by vacating the premises including removing his or her posessions before expiration of that legally delivered notice of termination.
				\item Upon expiration of the 3-7 day notice period provided, \management{} may remove \lodger{}'s possessions, and effect the removal of \lodger{} from \apt{} as a trespasser, without court order, pursuant to the provisions of Section 602.3 of the California Penal Code or other applicable provisions of law, because any right of \lodger{} to remain in the dwelling unit or any part thereof is terminated by operation of law pursuant to the provisions of Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code.
			\end{enumerate} 
	
		\item \textbf{Impermanence, \rules{}, and \standards{}}\\*
			\lodger{} further understands and agrees with the following: 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item This Agreement is temporary and although automatically renewing weekly, this Agreement will eventually be terminated by \management{} when \management{} will no longer rent \room{} to anyone, even if \lodger{} has always been in good standing under this Agreement. 
				\item \management{} desires that \lodger{} clearly understands how to avoid premature termination of this Agreement, and so has provided rules as listed in Schedule A of this Agreement (``\rules{}''), and housekeeping standards as listed in Schedule B of this Agreement (``\standards{}''). 
				\item \management{} may change or add to \rules{} and \standards{} with 7 day written notice, providing those subsequent drafts to \lodger{} so that \lodger{} may obey them. 
				\item \lodger{} shall obey the \rules{} and \standards{} as currently and subsequently drafted and delivered to \lodger{} in order to avoid premature termination of this Agreement.
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{Honesty}\\*
			The \lodger{} understands and agrees that \management{} is entering into this Agreement in reliance upon the truth, completeness and accuracy of information provided in the \lodger{}'s initial application for a lodging rental. Furthermore, the \lodger{} understands and agrees that \management{} is relying on the truth, completeness and accuracy of all future information to be provided by the \lodger{}. Should it be discovered that any such information is false, misleading, or incomplete, \management{} may terminate this Agreement which may result in additional rent being owed by the \lodger{} and/or lead to other legal action and remedies which may be appropriate under the law.
