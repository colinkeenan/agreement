					\item 7 days in any other case. 
				\end{enumerate} 
				The Notice of Termination shall both state that \lodger{} is not welcome in \apt{} anymore, and provide reminder that only Owner and \lodger{} reside in this \apt{}.

			\item \textbf{Service Of Termination Notice} \label{service}
				\quad When a notice of termination requires service pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure 1162, such service may be made by either:

					\item If such place of business cannot be ascertained, or a person of suitable age or discretion there cannot be found, then service may be made by affixing a copy in a conspicuous place in the \room{}, and also sending a copy through the mail addressed to the \lodger{} at \apt{}.

		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Notices} \quad 
		\begin{enumerate} 
			\item \textbf{Notice To Lodger} \quad

			\item by the written consent of both \management{} and the \lodger{}, or 
			\item \management{} (without the written consent of the \lodger{}) at any time during the term of the Agreement upon 7 day written notice. 
		\end{enumerate}
				
		This item \ref{modifications} of this section of the Agreement, shall not apply to changes authorized by this Agreement or law.
	\item \textbf{Waivers} \quad 
		\management{}'s failure to require strict compliance with any covenant, term or condition of this Agreement, or to exercise any right \management{} may have by reason of this Agreement, shall not be deemed a waiver by \management{} of such covenant, condition, term or right. \management{}'s acceptance of rent with the knowledge of any default by the \lodger{} to this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such default, nor shall it limit or impair \management{}'s right to enforce any subsequent default of the same covenant, condition, term or right. 
	\item \textbf{Captions} \quad 
		Section headings of this Agreement are solely for convenience of the parties and shall not be used to explain, modify, simplify, or aid in the interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 
	\item \textbf{Rights And Remedies Cumulative} \quad 
		All rights and remedies that \management{} may have under this Agreement or at law are cumulative and nonexclusive. 
	\item \textbf{Severability} \quad 
		If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will not be affected. In lieu of any provision which a court of competent jurisdiction finds to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, there will be added as a part of this Agreement a provision as similar to such provision as may be possible, yet be legal, valid and enforceable. 
	\item \textbf{the Effect Of Prior Rental Agreements} \quad 
		Providing the \lodger{} is not in default of any term, condition or covenant under any other rental agreement that is in force between the \lodger{} and \management{} at the time this Agreement becomes effective, all prior rental agreements will terminate. In all cases where the \lodger{} is in default under a rental agreement with \management{} at the time this Agreement becomes effective, any default under that agreement shall be deemed a default of this Agreement. 
	\item \textbf{Automatic Renewal} \quad 
		Unless terminated, this Agreement shall be automatically renewed weekly on the same terms and conditions.
