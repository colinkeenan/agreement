\section{\specifics{}} \label{specifics}
This agreement, titled \agreementtitle{} (the ``Agreement'') is entered into by and between \mom{} (``Owner''), and the individual identified as Lodger (``Lodger'') for the week-to-week rental of that certain furnished lodging (``\room{}'') within that certain apartment house (``\apt{}'') occupied and owned by Owner, where the Lodger, \room{}, and \apt{} are identified in items \ref{lodger}, \ref{room}, and \ref{apt} of section \ref{definitions} of this Agreement. Further details of the \room{} are set forth in Schedule \ref{therental}. Even though personally occupying \apt{}, Owner together with her family members who have been authorized to act as the Owner's managers of the \apt{} and are identified in item \ref{management} of section \ref{definitions} of this Agreement, will hereinafter be referred to as management (``\management{}''). Only Owner and Lodger shall reside in \apt{}. All references to other residents are references to the residents of the condominium building with address listed in item \ref{condo} in section \ref{specifics} of this Agreement (``\condo{}''), in which \apt{} is located.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Applicability of Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code}\\*
			The Lodger understands and agrees with the following:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item this Agreement is week-to-week with weekly payments of \rent{} (the ``Rent'') to be made in accordance with Schedule \ref{payments}
				\item Lodger is contracting with Owner, the owner of \apt{}, for \room{}, a room within \apt{}
				\item \apt{} is personally occupied by Owner
				\item Owner retains a right of access to all areas of \apt{} occupied by Lodger 
				\item Owner has overall control of \apt{} 
				\item no one other than Lodger and Owner reside in \apt{}. 
			\end{enumerate}
			Therefore, \management{} may exercise it's rights under Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Upon receipt of 3-7 day notice of termination delivered to Lodger as outlined in items \ref{terminate} and \ref{service} of Schedule \ref{terminating} of this Agreement, Lodger agrees to obey the provisions of Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code by vacating the premises including removing his or her possessions before expiration of that legally delivered notice of termination.
				\item As set forth in the provisions of Section 1946.5 of California Civil Code, upon expiration of the 3-7 day notice period provided, \management{} may effect the removal of Lodger from \apt{} pursuant to the provisions of Section 602.3 of the California Penal Code or other applicable provisions of law, because any right of Lodger to remain in the dwelling unit or any part thereof is terminated by operation of law.
			\end{enumerate} 

		\item \textbf{\behavior{}}.
			\management{} will terminate this Agreement for smoking as set forth in item \ref{smoking} of Schedule \ref{therental} of this Agreement, and also for criminal or drug related activities as set forth in items \ref{criminal} and \ref{drug} of Schedule \ref{behavior} of this Agreement. \management{} may terminate this Agreement for failure to meet all the obligations set forth in item \ref{obligations} of Schedule \ref{behavior} of this Agreement.
	
		\item \textbf{Impermanence, \rules{}, and \standards{}}\\
			Lodger further understands and agrees with the following: 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item This Agreement is temporary and although automatically renewing weekly, this Agreement will eventually be terminated by \management{} when \management{} will no longer rent \room{} to anyone, even if Lodger has always been in good standing under this Agreement. 
				\item \management{} desires that Lodger clearly understands how to avoid premature termination of this Agreement, and so has provided rules as listed in Schedule \ref{rules} of this Agreement (``\rules{}''), and housekeeping standards as listed in Schedule \ref{standards} of this Agreement (``\standards{}''). 
				\item \management{} may change or add to \rules{} and \standards{} with 7 day written notice, providing those subsequent drafts to Lodger so that Lodger may obey them. 
				\item Lodger shall obey the \rules{} and \standards{} as currently and subsequently drafted and delivered to Lodger in order to avoid premature termination of this Agreement.
			\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{\meta{}}.
			Further terms relating to this Agreement itself are set forth in Schedule \ref{meta} of this Agreement.

		\item \textbf{\disclosures{}}. See Schedule \ref{disclosures}: \disclosures{}.
		\item \textbf{Honesty}.
			The Lodger understands and agrees that \management{} is entering into this Agreement in reliance upon the truth, completeness and accuracy of information provided in the Lodger's initial application for a lodging rental. Furthermore, the Lodger understands and agrees that \management{} is relying on the truth, completeness and accuracy of all future information to be provided by the Lodger. Should it be discovered that any such information is false, misleading, or incomplete, \management{} may terminate this Agreement which may result in additional rent being owed by the Lodger and/or lead to other legal action and remedies which may be appropriate under the law.
