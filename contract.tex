\section*{Terms of Employment}
Dear \lname{},\\

Thank you for providing this much-needed care! The following contract is to make sure we are all on the same page about responsibilities, vacation days, taxes, payments and schedules. The attached ``\rules{}'' (Attachment \ref{rules}), ``\basic{}'' (Attachment \ref{basic}), ``\bathroom{}'' (Attachment \ref{bathroom}), ``\shopping{}'' (Attachment \ref{shopping}), ``\bigchores{}'' (Attachment \ref{bigchores}), and ``\health{}'' (Attachment \ref{health}) offer a little more information about how our family works and how we are hoping you can assist our loved one, written down so it can be clear. While the below contract is very black and white, the attachments will be agile documents as we know things might change.

This contract, executed on \datefillin{}, between \mom{} (``Employer'') and \lname{} (``Employee'') has the following terms of employment:

\subsection*{Start Date}

Employee will start employment on \textbf{\startdate{}} and continue until either party elects to terminate the relationship.

\subsection*{Worksite Address}

Work will be performed at 104 North Wilson Ave, Apt. 13, Pasadena, CA 91106 (``Employer's Home'').

The Employee may choose to rent a room in the Employer's Home upon the terms set forth in the \agreementtitle{}.

\subsection*{Notes About The Person Requiring Care}

The person you will care for, \mom{}, born February 7,1943 has been diagnosed with diabetes, scoliosis and severe arthritis, has difficulty swallowing, has had surgery for thryroid, kidney and, most recently, breast cancer, has high cholesterol and has floaters in her eyes. Though undiagnosed, she also suffers from extreme anxieties, may have auditory or visual hallucinations, and minor memory loss.

As a result of these conditions, she is unable to lift her arms above her head, walks hunched over with a pronounced limp, needs to use a four wheel walker at all times, requires help with dressing, grooming and bathing, must take care in transferring from a chair to her walker and from her walker to a toilet, may only eat certain types of foods, is very nervous about being driven in a car, and is reluctant to leave home, bathe or brush teeth.

She is able to ascend and descend stairs, use the bathroom alone and is able to feed herself.

The person you will care for can be left alone.

\subsection*{Work Schedule, Responsibilities, and Compensation}
