\section*{Terms of Employment}
Dear \lname{},\\

Thank you for providing this much-needed care! The following contract is to make sure we are all on the same page about responsibilities, sick days, taxes, payments and schedules. The attached ``\rules{}'' (Attachment \ref{rules}), ``\basic{}'' (Attachment \ref{basic}), ``\bathroom{}'' (Attachment \ref{bathroom}), ``\shopping{}'' (Attachment \ref{shopping}), ``\bigchores{}'' (Attachment \ref{bigchores}), and ``\health{}'' (Attachment \ref{health}) offer a little more information about how our family works and how we are hoping you can assist our loved one, written down so it can be clear. While the below contract is very black and white, the attachments will be agile documents as we know things might change.

This contract, executed on \datefillin{}, between \mom{} (``Employer'') and \lname{} (``Employee'') has the following terms of employment:

\subsection*{Start Date}

Employee will start employment on \textbf{\startdate{}} and continue until either party elects to terminate the relationship.

\subsection*{Worksite Address}

Work will be performed at 104 North Wilson Ave, Apt. 13, Pasadena, CA 91106 (``Employer's Home'').

The Employee may choose to rent a room in the Employer's Home upon the terms set forth in the \agreementtitle{}.

\subsection*{Notes About The Person Requiring Care}

\input{impairmentcontent}

She is able to ascend and descend stairs, use the bathroom alone and is able to feed herself.

The person you will care for can be left alone.

\subsection*{Work Schedule, Responsibilities, and Compensation}
The work schedule, responsibilities, and compensation depend on whether or not the Employee is renting a room in the Employer's Home, and how many days a week the Employee is allowed to work.
\subsubsection*{Three Categories of Employee}

\noindent Employee is a category\\
\noindent(check one)
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\checkbox] \ref{allweek}. \allweek{}
	\item[\checkbox] \ref{weekend}. \weekend{}
	\item[\checkbox] \ref{weekday}. \weekday{}
\end{itemize}

Regardless of what category of employee you are, you will need to check-in by phone at the start of each shift and check-out by phone or internet at the end of each shift as set forth in the \basic{}. Your daily morning and evening chores are set forth in \basic{}, \bathroom{}, and \shopping{}. 

You will \textbf{not} be responsible for doing anything listed in ``\notyourjob{}'' (Attachment \ref{notyourjob}). 

Further responsibilities, your work schedule, and compensation are listed under your category of employee below.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{\allweek{}}. \label{allweek}
		Is not renting a room in the Employer's Home. Is required to work five (5) days a week, and be available for an occasional 6th or 7th day of work. For any 7th day of work done in a calendar month, the employee will have another day off in another week that month. In addition to the responsibilities already listed, once a week, you will do a bigger chore from the \bigchores{} list. You will also assist with showers a few times a month as set forth in \shower{}. 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Morning Shift}. 8am until chores are completed or Employee is out of time (typically finished at about 9am, but may finish anytime between 8:30am and 10am)
			\item \textbf{Evening Shift}. 7pm until chores are completed or Employee is out of time (typically finished at about 8pm, but may finish anytime between 7:30pm and 9pm)
			\item \textbf{12 Average Weekly Hours Plus Medical Appointments}. The average weekly hours in any calendar month, not counting medical and dental appointments, should be within half an hour of twelve (12). 
				\begin{enumerate}
