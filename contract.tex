Dear \caregiver{},

Thank you for providing this much-needed care! The following contract is to make sure we are all on the same page about responsibilities, vacation days, taxes, payments and schedules. The attached ``\rules{}'' (Attachment \ref{rules}), ``\basic{}'' (Attachment \ref{basic}), ``\bathroom{}'' (Attachment \ref{bathroom}), ``\shopping{}'' (Attachment \ref{shopping}), ``\bigchores{}'' (Attachment \ref{bigchores}), and ``\health{}'' (Attachment \ref{health}) offer a little more information about how our family works and how we are hoping you can assist our loved one, written down so it can be clear. While the below contract is very black and white, the attachments will be agile documents as we know things might change.

This contract, executed on \datefillin{}, between \mom{} (``Employer'') and \caregiver{} (``Employee'') has the following terms of employment:

\section{Start Date}

Employee will start employment on \textbf{\startdate{}} and continue until either party elects to terminate the relationship.

\section{Worksite Address}

Work will be performed at 104 North Wilson Ave, Apt. 13, Pasadena, CA 91106 (``Employer's Home'').

The Employee may choose to rent a room in the Employer's Home upon the terms set forth in the \agreementtitle{} (``Room Rental'').

As a result of these conditions, she is unable to lift her arms above her head, walks hunched over with a pronounced limp, needs to use a four wheel walker at all times, requires help with dressing, grooming and bathing, must take care in transferring from a chair to her walker and from her walker to a toilet, may only eat certain types of foods, is very nervous about being driven in a car, and is reluctant to leave home, bathe or brush teeth.

She is able to ascend and descend stairs, use the bathroom alone and is able to feed herself.

The person you will care for can be left alone.

\section{Work Schedule And Responsibilities}

If the Employee is not in the Room Rental (a ``non-LIVE-IN Employee''), the work schedule consists of sixteen hours a week done in two shifts seven days a week, along with weekday medical and dental appointments scheduled by the Employee. If the Employee is in the Room Rental (a ``LIVE-IN Employee''), the work schedule consists of fourteen hours done in two shifts Monday through Friday, along with weekday medical and dental appointments scheduled by the Employee. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Morning Shift}. 8am until chores are completed or Employee is out of time (typically finished at about 9am, but may finish anytime between 8:30am and 10am)
	\item \textbf{Evening Shift}. 7pm until chores are completed or Employee is out of time (typically finished at about 8pm, but may finish anytime between 7:30pm and 9pm)
	\item \textbf{16 Weekly Hours Plus Medical Appointments}. The total number of hours, not counting medical and dental appointments, should be within half an hour of sixteen hours each week. 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The Employee should attempt to schedule no more than two medical appointments in the same work week.

\end{enumerate}

You will need to check in by phone at the start of each shift and check out by phone or internet at the end of each shift as set forth in the \rules{}. Your daily morning and evening chores are set forth in \basic{}, \bathroom{}, and \shopping{}. Once a week, you will do a bigger chore from the \bigchores{} list. You will also assist with showers a few times a month as set forth in \shower{}. You are to spend about sixteen hours each week on the chores referenced in this paragraph.

You will \textbf{not} be responsible for doing anything listed in ``\notyourjob{}'' (Attachment \ref{notyourjob}).
