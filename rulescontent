\subsection*{Family Philosophy}
We are hoping to respect Joan's wishes to remain at home where she is most comfortable so that she may continue to enjoy her retirement on her own terms. Though our mother may not have the same cognitive ability that she once had, she is intelligent and highly educated: she is not a child and should not be treated as such. Please treat her the same way as you would like to be treated---with kindness, compassion, understanding and respect. By relying on these principles to guide your care, you will garner her trust, making your job easier and our mother happier. A request from a trusted friend is much easier to follow than a command from someone you do not like or respect. Without this trust, she may become anxious and just shut down and refuse to follow any requests. Of course, you must never use physical force or threats. Nor should you use humiliating or cruel comments as a tool for getting her to follow your instructions. These types of comments are not effective, can be a form of emotional abuse which is illegal, and just make her more emotionally upset. Tips for handling resistance or behavior issues can be found on page \pageref{tips}.

Your responsibilities are outlined below and in the Senior Care Contract. Joan's family will continue to take care of everything else.  For example, we will continue to help Joan with any financial or legal matters, the repair and maintenance of her home, health matters, and other day to day needs. For your convenience, we have included a list of family members and their contact information on page \pageref{family}.

\subsection*{Family History}

Our mother is a fiercely independent person who has lived on her own for most of her life. She has been married and divorced two times. She has two children, Colin and Charlene, from the first marriage and two children, Renee and Allegra, from the second. She now has seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren. Two of her grandchildren, Rachel Ogletree and Jessica Gould, live in town, as does her older daughter, Charlene. She has developed a very close relationship with Rachel and her husband Roy as they have checked in on her and visited her often throughout these past few years. Her only brother, Bob, lives in England.

She has had many jobs throughout her life and sometimes more than one job at a time to make ends meet. She has worked as an editor at an engineering firm and a bank, a secretary and copy editor for a number of companies, as well as a stenographer. She has always been keenly interested in literature and poetry and has written scores of poems herself. She chose to retire as soon as she could to reap the benefits of all that hard work.

\subsection*{Ongoing Diagnosed Health Conditions}

\input{healthtable}
\subsection*{Attention}

Joan may be left at home safely. She is capable of transferring from her chair to her walker, going up and down the stairs independently and is able to transfer from her walker to the toilet. 

\subsection*{Medication Monitoring}

\subsection*{Physical or Cognitive Impairments}

\input{impairmentcontent}

She will require help with the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Bathing}. She may require help with removing her items of clothing before the shower. She is able to sit down and stand up from the bath transfer bench without help. She needs help with washing her hair and back. She may need help with drying herself off. Always make sure she wears her glasses after the shower is over.
\item \textbf{Dressing}. She may need help with undressing and dressing. Because of the extreme difficulty she has with dressing, she prefers to remain in the same clothes until the next bath. Of course, if she has a major spill that cannot be tidied up, please do help her to get changed into clean clothes.
\item \textbf{Grooming}. She will need help (or at least prompting) with brushing her hair, applying any body lotions, maintaining her fingernails and cleaning her ears. She needs help maintaining her toenails, and is currently seeing a Kaiser Permanente doctor every three months for that. Please use your best judgment to prompt or help Joan maintain her grooming.
\item \textbf{Dental}. Though she is fully capable of brushing her teeth on her own, she is very reluctant to do so. She will not use an electric toothbrush even though recommended by her Dentist; so, there's no need to get another one if the Dentist makes that suggestion again. Although it may seem she is not caring for her teeth, she nevertheless has almost all of her original teeth and no current dental issues. She has crowns and one tooth implant that has been crowned. Make yearly visits to her Dentist (or as recommended by him) and follow his advice. Her Dentist is Robin Stephen L DDS, 1245 W Huntington Dr \# 103 Arcadia 91007 (626) 795-4412. Do not make appointments with other dentists that may call saying she hasn't been seen in over a year.
\item \textbf{Bathroom}. She is capable of using the downstairs bathroom on her own because the commode is at a higher level. She has difficulty sitting down and getting up from a regular toilet, but has no problems using a handicap toilet. Thus, you should only have her use a handicap toilet whenever she is in public. When she is at a family member's home, we will have that family member help her use the bathroom.
\item \textbf{Transferring from Walker to Car}. She has not required help getting into and out of the cars or buses, but takes care and must not be rushed.
\item \textbf{Stairs in Public}. Do not use stairs in public unless it is absolutely necessary. She is able to ascend and descend stairs safely at home by using the railings on either side of the stairwell. Public stairwells are often too wide or do not have any railings rendering her vulnerable to falls. If you must use a stairwell or even ascend one or two steps, you must be at her side at all times. She is not likely to attempt stairs in public, but is tempted to rest by sitting on a step. Strongly encourage her to use the seat on her walker instead because she will experience great difficulty getting up from the stairs and will refuse help.
\item \textbf{Chairs}. If the only chair available doesn't have arm rests, encourage her to sit on the seat in her walker instead because she will have difficulty standing from the chair and will refuse help.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Typical Reactions to Receiving Care and Tips for Handling Behavior Issues} \label{tips}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{General Reactions}. Aside from the specific occasions outlined below, Joan is usually very accepting of offers of assistance. She will take her medications as scheduled and prompted, will obligingly eat her meals and is content to let you take care of the general housekeeping.
	\item \textbf{Refusal to Bathe}. She may refuse to bathe from time to time. Because these activities are very difficult for her, you should approach her refusal with kindness and understanding, but make it clear that she needs to take a bath to remain healthy. Of course, you must never use physical force or threats to make her bathe. Nor should you use humiliating or cruel comments as a tool for getting her to bathe. These types of comments are not effective and just make her more emotionally upset. Follow the instructions in \shower{} for when and how to prompt her to bathe.
	\item \textbf{Refusal to Drive in a Car}. She is very fearful of being driven in a car and is absolutely terrified of driving on the freeway.  You should use surface streets at all times whenever you are transporting her in a car. Again kindness, understanding and respect go a long way. Statements such as ``I know that driving can be a little scary, but do know that I will only take surface streets and I will make sure to drive extremely carefully and safely. Your comfort and wellbeing is very important to me'' could help her overcome her fears. It sometimes helps to suggest that she close her eyes while you drive. Always have her sit in the back seat. 
	\item \textbf{Requests for Sweets}. She has a very difficult time controlling her desire to eat sugary foods. Please keep any of these foods out of sight and in a safe place. She may also request that you buy sweet foods for her. Because of her diabetic condition, please follow the guidance provided below for these types of foods.
	\item \textbf{Getting Stuck}. In the past, Joan has had extreme difficulty with getting up from a chair or a couch. On those occasions, she has completely refused any offers of help and we have had to call 911 for assistance. Though she is quite stiff and does sometime complain of hip pain, it appears that she is physically capable of getting up with assistance in those situations. Only if absolutely necessary and if there is no possibility of injury to yourself, assist her to stand up.  If she refuses that assistance, please contact a family member immediately.
	\item \textbf{When to Inform the Family}. If her refusals become more prevalent or adamant, please contact a family member immediately. We are all in this together, so please feel free to call at any time with any questions you may have.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional Care}

List of current doctors and recurring appointments

\subsection*{Eating/Food Preferences or Restrictions and Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{General Instructions}. You will be preparing three healthy, nutritious and well balanced (but small) meals for Joan. Eating or keeping Joan company are not part of your duties so you will be checking out with Colin almost immediately after serving a meal, and you may leave after that. You will personally serve Breakfast and Dinner at the end of your shifts. Lunch and snacks should be prepared and placed in or beside the refrigerator during your shift. Try to avoid simply leaving all the snacks out for her to eat as she pleases. Measure out an appropriate amount of snack food and put beside or in the refrigerator as required. She should be encouraged to stand up and get her own lunch and snacks that you have prepared, rather than leaving everything next to her. Excess snack food should be placed in a high cupboard that she would have great difficulty reaching for herself.

	She has difficulty swallowing, please try to stick to softer, easier to chew foods. Fresh meat should either be well marbled with fat or be prepared with a sweet sauce to make it easier to swallow. Lunch meats like ham, salami, and bologna are fine for lunch. We are not overly concerned about the amount of fat that she eats.

	Although eating too many carbs at once will raise her blood sugar to levels that may damage internal organs, her insulin injections have been prescribed to balance out a steady supply of carbs throughout the day. Eating fewer carbs than usual can lead to Joan experiencing dangerously low blood sugar between your work shifts which, if repeated often, may eventually lead Joan to suffer minor brain damage. So, a sweet sauce with meat is fine, and she will need a carb (bread, noodles, rice, chips, fruit, milk, plain yogurt \ldots) with every meal and as snacks between meals as well. A desert made with real sugar served with dinner or left within reach in the freezer/refrigerator is fine too, but do not give her desert after every meal even if she asks for that.

	Colin will be ordering almost all the food you will be preparing through Amazon Fresh. The deliveries will be left by the front door before 7am in tote bags including coolers, and you will be putting away the food immediately after checking in with Colin. Amazon Fresh may not have a certain item, for example, a particular fresh meat or fish. In that case, Colin will ask you to pick it up during your next personal shopping trip. When already shopping for yourself, you will need to call Colin to check-in just before shopping for the item asked for, and then call Colin again to check-out once the item has been obtained. Finding an asked for item should not add more than fifteen minutes to your shopping trip, and you are not to travel to other stores to find it. Substitutions are fine. Since you will already be in the store when you start shopping for Joan, you will not be paid a mileage expense.

	You will not have much time to prepare food during yours shifts, so Colin will only suggest meals that can be prepared in the time you are allowed to work. However, you may wish for Joan to try something you cooked for yourself. You may serve left overs of personal meals, replacing the food you gave away by taking some of her food for yourself. This will allow you to provide more variety in Joan's meals and also make you more efficient on the job since the food will have already been prepared outside of your shift. You will not be paid for preparing food for yourself, only for serving the left overs to Joan. You may also serve Joan restaurant leftovers. 

	As outlined in the \basic{}, you will need to measure her blood sugar levels before breakfast and dinner. She will measure these blood levels herself before lunch and every couple of hours after dinner before going to bed. Although you will not be adjusting her medications, the blood sugar readings will help Colin to know if you are providing the correct amount of carbs for her throughout the day and he will let you know when you check in for your shift if any adjustment is needed. He will also be providing readings to her doctor so that, if needed, her prescribed insulin dose can be adjusted. You will not likely get a low reading (below 70) during your shift, but if you do, provide a serving of carbs and check again every fifteen minutes as outlined in \insulin{}. If you have not already given her the insulin during that shift, and she gets a reading below 70, do not give her the insulin. It is common to get readings substantually higher than the targets, and this is nothing to worry about, but she tends to want even more sweets when her blood sugar is already too high, so please explain that you will not help her to harm her organs with too much sugar and so will not bring her any sweets. Still provide the normal serving of carbs with her breakfast or dinner though, regardless of blood sugar levels.

	Breakfast: She will usually want 3 spoons plain yogurt topped with an equal amount of granola. Sometimes she may want a hard boiled or fried egg with buttered bread or toast and fruit/tomato. You should ask if she wants coffee or anything else before checking out. She is capable of making coffee for herself, so once checked out, you should not help her further. She needs to be encouraged to get up out of her chair and do those things for herself that she can.


	Lunch: Sandwich and fruit or salad. Although she can heat things in the microwave, it's best to prepare cold lunches since she will be more likely to eat them. She prefers lettuce and tomato on her sandwich and has enjoyed creamy Caesar dressing, mustard, and mustard seed on her sandwiches as well. Any lunch meat will work: bologna, salami, ham, thin sliced roasted beef or turkey, sub kit meat \ldots, and tuna mixed with plenty of creamy Caesar dressing and some chopped onions is good too as long as there's also tomato and lettuce. The sandwich needs to be thin enough so that it doesn't fall apart though, and she usually only wants half of a sandwich. Any fresh in-season fruit is fine. For salad, as long as it's got lettuce and tomato, she'll probably like it, but add mushrooms and red bell pepper or brocoli and cauliflower for more vitamins. Use whatever salad dressing Colin has ordered. If you didn't have time to make lunch, let her know to eat a protein bar, chips and fruit for lunch.
	
	If you will be around at lunch time, you may take a short third shift that day, preparing and serving lunch around noon instead of preparing lunch in advance. A previous shift should have been shorter than usual since you didn't prepare lunch during that shift. You will have to check in and out by calling Colin. If preparing the lunch (or bringing her something that you got while eating out), you will be able to serve a greater variety, including a hot lunch: ravioli, soup, macaroni and cheese, one slice of cheese pizza or topped with mushroom olive and tomato from any restaurant - she likes the \$5 Little Caesar pizza and only wants one slice, plain taco from Del Taco, plain hamburger (not cheeseburger because she doesn't like American cheese) from McDonald's, warmed up leftovers from dinner, etc. Her appetite is very small and restaurant food that you bring to her should only cost about \$1. You should take some of her food to make up for that.

	
	Snacks: Fruit should always be available in the refrigerator, but she's not likely to get any on her own. She's always looking for sweets, and putting a little out for her is fine, especially sugar free candy and low sugar high protein bars. She's not likely to over eat the protein bars, so leaving them all out is fine. A serving or two of carbs should be put out as well. She likes plain yellow corn tortilla chips, potato chips with sour cream (must be refrigerated), cheese puffs, half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, bread and butter \ldots


	Dinner: Colin will provide suggested recipes with each delivery of food. Her appetite various conciderably and what she may rave about one day, she'll hardly touch on another day. Some meals that she has loved (and also barely touched at other times) are: tilapia fried in olive oil with asparagus and buttered toast; lamb rib chops broiled with artichoke and macoroni \& cheese; previously prepared beef and beans reheated and served in a burrito with shredded cheese and onions; stir fry made with tender pork or chicken (preferably thigh meat), broccoli, carrots, red bell pepper, onions, mushrooms, and a sauce made from soy sauce, rice water, brown sugar, and the juices/seasoning from the chicken and vegetables all served over microwave-cooked white rice; microwave-cooked peeled and sliced potatoes and carrots buttered and seasoned with popcorn salt with a side of any meat she likes to eat; a slice of cheese pizza from a \$5 Little Ceaser's pizza with a home made salad. She enjoys diet coke with any lunch or dinner. Leaving a bowl of icecream in the freezer or some real-sugar candy beside the refrigerator as desert is fine with dinner, but not other meals.

	\item{Eating Out}. Family will try to get her out of the house sometimes to eat at a restaurant. You will not be taking her out to eat as part of your job.

	\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Running Errands} You are not expected to run errands on a weekly basis, but Colin may ask you to run an errand which will be explained on a case by case basis. You are not to run errands just because Joan asks: all approved errands will be requested by Colin. Food and other household items will be delivered by Amazon Fresh. Medicine refills will arrive in the mail. You will pickup new prescriptions immediately after they were prescribed while you are still on duty for the medical or dental appointment.

\subsection*{Visitors and Contact Information}
We have no specific restrictions on who is allowed to visit Joan and the length of time they may visit. However, please keep a list of visitors and ask for names the first time a visitor unknown to you visits. Please let Colin know about new visitors.\\

\subsubsection*{Apartment Manager} The house apartment owned by Joan is located in Wilson Manor, a condominium building, that is managed by Beven \& Brock Property Management, 99 S Lake Ave \#100, Pasadena, CA 91101, (626) 795-3282. However, there's no reason for you to contact them. Joan, being the owner of her apartment, is responsible for the maintenance of it. Contact Colin with any concerns that you might want to bring to an apartment manager.

\subsubsection*{Contractors such as plumbers, heating/ac, handyman and etc.}

Please contact Colin if something in the house needs to be fixed or for regular maintenance. Either you or an available family member or family friend will need to be in attendance at \textbf{all} times while the worker is in her home.

\subsection*{Sleep Preferences}

Joan spends a good portion of her time during the day in her easy chair.  Because she has severe arthritis and scoliosis and is very uncomfortable sleeping flat on a bed, she not only prefers to sleep in her easy chair, but her doctor recommends it. She often sleeps with the TV on. She doesn't follow a particular nap or sleep schedule, however, she will need to be woken up for her daily breakfast. Because her easy chair serves as her bed as well, we ask that you change the seat covers or sheets every few weeks as part of one of the \bigchores{} or when needed.

\subsection*{Communication}

You will be talking, emailing, and uploading information to Colin daily as part of your check-in and check-out procedures for each shift. Although most communication will go through Colin, you may talk to other family members as they visit or call as well, and they will play a part in overseeing your work.

\subsection*{Termination Policy}

Because you have been employed on an ``at-will'' basis, you may terminate your employment at any time upon 2 weeks written notice and we may terminate your employment for any reason with or without cause or notice as set forth in the Senior Care Contract. Though not limited to these reasons, the following may be reasons why we might choose to terminate your employment:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Allowing Joan Harrison's safety to be compromised
\item Inconsistent or non-performance of agreed-upon job responsibilities
\item Re-negotiating terms of employment with Joan Harrison directly
\item Failing to report to Colin any additional monies or gifts given to you by Joan Harrison (undisclosed monetary gifts or negotiations with Joan herself could be construed as financial abuse, a crime subject to prosecution)
\item Concerning issues in background checks
\item Dishonesty
\item Stealing
\item Breach of confidentiality clause in the Senior Care Contract
\item Persistent absenteeism or tardiness
\item Unapproved guests
\item Smoking while in the home or on Wilson Manor property
\item Alcohol consumption or being under the influence of alcohol while on duty
\item Use of an illegal drug whether or not prosecuted
\item Criminal activity on or off the property whether or not prosecuted
\item Use of phone or computer other than as required for the job while on duty in the home (such use is fine while waiting during a medical or dental appointment)
\end{enumerate}
