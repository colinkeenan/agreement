\section*{Showers}
The Employer is reluctant to take showers. Please handle this as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item On each shift where you potentially have time to assist with the shower, please suggest that she take one, but don't spend time trying to convince her.
	\item After a week, be more insistent, for about fifteen minutes.
	\item After two weeks, put her commode in the upstairs bathroom and follow her upstairs when she goes to the bathroom. She should take a shower after that. Assist as you have been trained and as required. Put the commode back into the downstairs bathroom after she takes her shower.
\end{enumerate}
When checking in or out of each shift, please tell Colin whenever she takes her shower.
