\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Always above 70}. If at 70 or less, leave her insulin with her as usual, but ask her not to take it until she talks to Colin. Call Colin and leave a message with the low reading if he doesn't answer. Imediately have her eat a single serving of carbs (double serving if blood sugar below 50) before her meal and check again after 15 minutes. Repeat until her blood sugar is above 70. 
	\item A single serving of carbs is 15g. Read the nutrition information on the package. Examples:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item 4 sugar cubes
			\item large glass of milk
			\item double serving: coffee with 7 sugar cubes \& half cup milk
			\item large slice of bread
			\item read label on candy/cookies/icecream and give 15g worth
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Blood Sugar Reading Targets
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Before Breakfast: 80 - 120}
			\item \textbf{Before Lunch \& Dinner: 71 - 130}
			\item \textbf{Two hours after Dinner: 120 - 160}
			\item \textbf{Four hours after Dinner: 110 - 140}
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Under no circumstances are you to provide additional insulin beyond the prescribed amount. Just don't help her to eat even more sweets when her blood sugar is already too high.
