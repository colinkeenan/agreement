\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Always above 70}. If at 70 or less, skip her insulin if not already given and immediately provide plenty of carbs (coffee with milk \& 8 lumps of real sugar and bread, milk and bread, banana, real sugar sweets like candy, cookies, ice cream\ldots) and check again in 15 minutes.
	\item \textbf{Before Breakfast: 80 - 120}
	\item \textbf{Before Lunch \& Dinner: 71 - 130}
	\item \textbf{Two hours after Dinner: 120 - 160}
	\item \textbf{Four hours after Dinner: 110 - 140}
\end{enumerate}

Under no circumstances are you to provide additional insulin beyond the prescribed amount. Just don't help her to eat even more sweets when her blood sugar is already too high.
