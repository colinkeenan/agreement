\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Always above 70}. If at 70 or less, skip her insulin if not already given and immediately provide plenty of carbs (coffee with milk \& 8 lumps of real sugar and bread, milk and bread, banana, real sugar sweets like candy, cookies, ice cream\ldots) and check again in 15 minutes. This would normally happen a few hours after the last shot, so not during your shift. Colin will be calling and prompting Joan to check her blood sugar and eat as needed in between your shifts.
	\item \textbf{Before Breakfast: 80 - 120}
	\item \textbf{Before Lunch \& Dinner: 71 - 130}
	\item \textbf{Two hours after Dinner: 120 - 160}
	\item \textbf{Four hours after Dinner: 110 - 140}
\end{enumerate}

In order to avoid low readings, the prescribed insulin may not be enough to keep Joan below the upper targets. Under no circumstances are you to provide additional insulin beyond the prescribed amount. Just don't help her to eat even more sweets when her blood sugar is already too high.
